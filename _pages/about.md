I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at Florida International University, advised by Professor [Christian Poellabauer](https://users.cs.fiu.edu/~cpoellab/). My research interests include machine learning, speech analysis, and language processing. My research goal is to better assist with detecting and treating various disorders and diseases in humans by using data sources from speech, language, and other modalities.
